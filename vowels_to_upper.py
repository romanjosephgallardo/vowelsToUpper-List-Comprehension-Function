# pseudocode

# define a class called vowelsToUpper that takes a string as input
    # define a function called vowelsToUpper that takes a string as input
        # create a list of vowels
        # create a list of uppercase vowels
        # convert the string to a list of characters
        # create a list comprehension that checks if the character is a vowel
    # return a string with all vowels changed to their uppercase forms

# make a user input for the string
# instantiate the class and call the method
# print the result
